#javascript

Javascript is the language of the web. Nearly every website uses it. We are to leverage web APIs for our next project, building a little web app that will find us information about compounds.

Check out the finished version of the project [here](

### HTML, CSS, JS
HTML is the structure of our page. It's very similar to the frame of a house. It's simple, just defines where things go, what contains what, and maybe has some identifers for certain chunks of it. This is not 'functional', it's purely markup.

CSS is the styling of the page. It's the interior decoration of a house. Color of the walls, door knows, blinds. From CSS we control colors, sizes, outlines, boldings, dimensions. CSS is also not 'functional'.

Javascript is the functionality of the page. It's similar to the electrical and plumbing of a house. It allows you to react to user actions, such as clicking, scrolling, and typing. It's can change the interface, make requests for information on the web, basically do anything.



### API

An API stands for Application Program Interface. It's a uniform way for programs to talk and share data with eachother over the internet. Having open adn powerful APIs is incredibly important and many programs would not exist today without APIs.

Our Project uses the PubChem API which is very well documented. [Check it out here](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pug_rest/PUG_REST.html)

We make a request to the API to give us data using AJAX. When we get a response, we'll update the interface of our app.
