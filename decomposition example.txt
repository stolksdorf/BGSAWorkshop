"We have to go through the data and figure out which samples are good"

Okay how do I start?

"For each row Figure out if that row is good and flag it"

for each row
if row is good, then flag

What do you mean flag it?

"For each row figure out if that row is good and add an 'X' to the flag column"

for each row
if row is good, then set flag to 'X'

What does good mean?

"Good means if the sample value is within an acceptable range"

How do you figure out an acceptable range?

"if the sample value is within the target value and plus/minus the error, it's good"

for each row
if sample value is greater than target value - error and less than target value + error,
then set flag to 'X'

Where do I find these values in the row?

for each row
sample is column 8
target is column 2
error is column 4
flag is column 11
if sample is greater than target - error and less than target + error,
then set flag to 'X'

let's tab it out

for each row
	sample is column 8
	target is column 2
	error is column 4
	flag is column 11
	if sample is greater than target - error and less than target + error,
		then set flag to 'X'

Add some programming fluff

for each row in rows{
	var sample = row[8]
	var target = row[2]
	var error = row[4]
	var flag = row[11]
	flag is column 11
	if(sample > target - error && sample <target + error){
		flag = 'X'
	}
}
